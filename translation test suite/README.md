# MuCoW translation test suite

The MUCOW translation test suite comprises 9 language pairs, automatically harvested from different parallel corpora (books, eubooks, opensubs, tatoeba, ted).

We submit this variant to the partecipants of the Conference of Machine Translation (WMT) news translation task 2019, for the following language pairs: German->English (DE-EN), Finnish->English (FI-EN), Lithuanian->English (LT-EN), Russian->English (RU-EN), English->Czech (EN-CS), English->German (EN-DE), English->Finnish (EN-FI), English->Lithuanian (EN-LT) and English->Russian (EN-RU)

For a more detailed statistics please refer to Section 4 of the reference paper.


We release a script, `evaluate.py`, to compute precision, recall and fscore as explained in Section 5 of the reference paper.


`evaluate.py` takes in input XXX. For example:

`python evaluate.py XXX`
