# MuCoW test suite
MUCOW is a **mu**ltilingual **co**ntrastive **w**ord sense disambiguation test suite for machine translation that covers 16 language pairs with more than 200 thousand contrastive sentence pairs, automatically built from word-aligned parallel corpora and the wide-coverage multilingual sense inventory of BabelNet.


The MUCOW test suite is available in two variants: *"scoring test suite"* and *"translation test suite"*.
For a more detailed description of MUCOW please refer to Section 2 (Building MUCOW) and Section 4 (Translation test suites for WMT 2019) of the reference paper.


The first variant *"scoring test suite"* covers 11 language pairs with a total of almost 240 000 sentence pairs and relies on the ability of neural machine translation systems to score given translations: a sentence containing an ambiguous source word is paired with the correct reference translation and with a modified translation in which the ambiguous word has been replaced by a word of a different sense. A contrast is considered successfully detected if the reference translation obtains a higher score than an artificially modified translation. 


The second variant *"translation test suite"* covers 9 language pairs with a total of 15 600 sentences and relies on the translation output. After a system translates a sentence containing an ambiguous source word, we check whether any of the correct or incorrect target words (listed in a pre-compiled multilingual lexicon) can be identified in the translation output (recommended in tokenized and lowercased format).
